Title: Covariate Assisted Large-scale Multiple testing
Version: 1.8.0
Description: Statistical methods for multiple testing with covariate information. 
    Traditional multiple testing methods only consider a list of test statistics, 
    such as p-values. Our methods incorporate the auxiliary information, 
    such as the lengths of gene coding regions or the minor allele frequencies 
    of SNPs, to improve power.
